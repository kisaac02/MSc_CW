ML - Machine Learning Course
The dataset used is the UCI Adult dataset which is used to predict whether income exceeds $50,000 per year based on census data.  https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult.
The data consists of 6 numerical features, 8 categorical features a 1 target variable. Missing data is indicated with a ‘?’ in the dataset. The training data has 32,561 samples.
Used Keras
Steps
Encoded categorical variables with one hot encoding
Scaled numerical features
